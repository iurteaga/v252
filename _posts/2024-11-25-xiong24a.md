title: 'G-Transformer: Counterfactual Outcome Prediction under Dynamic and Time-varying
  Treatment Regimes'
abstract: In the context of medical decision making, counterfactual prediction enables
  clinicians to predict treatment outcomes of interest under alternative courses of
  therapeutic actions given observed patient history. Prior machine learning approaches
  for counterfactual predictions under time-varying treatments focus on static time-varying
  treatment regimes where treatments do not depend on previous covariate history.  In
  this work, we present G-Transformer, a Transformer-based framework supporting g-computation
  for counterfactual prediction under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies.
  G-Transfomer captures complex, long-range dependencies in time-varying covariates
  using a Transformer architecture. G-Transformer estimates the conditional distribution
  of relevant covariates given covariate and treatment history at each time point
  using an encoder architecture, then produces Monte Carlo estimates of counterfactual
  outcomes by simulating forward patient trajectories under treatment strategies of
  interest.  We evaluate G-Transformer extensively using two simulated longitudinal
  datasets from mechanistic models, and a real-world sepsis ICU dataset from MIMIC-IV.
  G-Transformer outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art counterfactual prediction
  models in these settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Transformer-based
  architecture for counterfactual outcome prediction under dynamic and time-varying
  treatment strategies.
