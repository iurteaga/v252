title: A Comprehensive View of Personalized Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Clinical
  Datasets
abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly being recognized as a key approach
  to overcoming the data silos that so frequently obstruct the training and deployment
  of machine-learning models in clinical settings. This work contributes to a growing
  body of FL research specifically focused on clinical applications along three important
  directions. First, we expand the FLamby benchmark (du Terrail et al., 2022a) to
  include a comprehensive evaluation of personalized FL methods and demonstrate substantive
  performance improvements over the original results. Next, we advocate for a comprehensive
  checkpointing and evaluation framework for FL to reflect practical settings and
  provide multiple comparison baselines. To this end, an open-source library aimed
  at making FL experimentation simpler and more reproducible is released. Finally,
  we propose an important ablation of PerFCL (Zhang et al., 2022). This ablation results
  in a natural extension of FENDA (Kim et al., 2016) to the FL setting. Experiments
  conducted on the FLamby benchmark and GEMINI datasets (Verma et al., 2017) show
  that the proposed approach is robust to heterogeneous clinical data and often outperforms
  existing global and personalized FL techniques, including PerFCL.
