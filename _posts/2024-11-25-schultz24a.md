title: Predictive Powered Inference for Healthcare; Relating Optical Coherence Tomography
  Scans to Multiple Sclerosis Disease Progression
abstract: Predictive power inference (PPI and PPI++) is a recently developed statistical
  method for computing confidence intervals and tests. It combines observations with
  machine-learning predictions. We use this technique to measure the association between
  the thickness of retinal layers and the time from the onset of Multiple Sclerosis
  (MS) symptoms. Further, we correlate the former with the Expanded Disability Status
  Scale, a measure of the progression of MS. In both cases, the confidence intervals
  provided with PPI++ improve upon standard statistical methodology, showing the advantage
  of PPI++ for answering inference problems in healthcare.
