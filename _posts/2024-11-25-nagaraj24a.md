title: 'Needles in Needle Stacks: Meaningful Clinical Information Buried in Noisy
  Sensor Data'
abstract: Central Venous Lines (C-Lines) and Arterial Lines (A-Lines) are routinely
  used in the Critical Care Unit (CCU) for blood sampling, medication administration,
  and high-frequency blood pressure measurement. Judiciously accessing these lines
  is important, as over-utilization is associated with significant in-hospital morbidity
  and mortality. Documenting the frequency of line-access is an important step in
  reducing these adverse outcomes. Unfortunately, the current gold-standard for documentation
  is manual and subject to error, omission, and bias. The high-frequency blood pressure
  waveform data from sensors in these lines are often noisy and full of artifacts.
  Standard approaches in signal processing remove noise artifacts before meaningful
  analysis. However, from bedside observations, we characterized a *distinct* artifact
  that occurs during each instance of C-Line or A-Line use. These artifacts are buried
  amongst physiological waveform and extraneous noise. We focus on Machine Learning
  (ML) models that can detect these artifacts from waveform data in real-time - finding
  needles in needle stacks, in order to automate the documentation of line-access.
  We built and evaluated ML classifiers running in real-time at a major childrenâ€™s
  hospital to achieve this goal. We demonstrate the utility of these tools for reducing
  documentation burden, increasing available information for bedside clinicians, and
  informing unit-level initiatives to improve patient safety.
