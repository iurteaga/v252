title: 'Semi-Supervised Generative Models for Disease Trajectories: A Case Study on
  Systemic Sclerosis'
abstract: We propose a deep generative approach using latent temporal processes for
  modeling and holistically analyzing complex disease trajectories, with a particular
  focus on Systemic Sclerosis (SSc). We aim to learn temporal latent representations
  of the underlying generative process that explain the observed patient disease trajectories
  in an interpretable and comprehensive way.  To enhance the interpretability of these
  latent temporal processes, we develop a semi-supervised approach for disentangling
  the latent space using established medical knowledge.  By combining the generative
  approach with medical definitions of different characteristics of SSc, we facilitate
  the discovery of new aspects of the disease.  We show that the learned temporal
  latent processes can be utilized for further data analysis and clinical hypothesis
  testing, including finding similar patients and clustering SSc patient trajectories
  into novel sub-types. Moreover, our method enables personalized online monitoring
  and prediction of multivariate time series with uncertainty quantification.
