title: 'DOSSIER: Fact Checking in Electronic Health Records while Preserving Patient
  Privacy'
abstract: Given a particular claim about a specific document, the fact checking problem
  is to determine if the claim is true and, if so, provide corroborating evidence.
  The problem is motivated by contexts where a document is too lengthy to quickly
  read and find an answer.  This paper focuses on electronic health records, or a
  medical dossier, where a physician has a pointed claim to make about the record.  Prior
  methods that rely on directly prompting an LLM may suffer from hallucinations and
  violate privacy constraints.  We present a system, DOSSIER, that verifies claims
  related to the tabular data within a document.  For a clinical record, the tables
  include timestamped vital signs, medications, and labs. DOSSIER weaves together
  methods for tagging medical entities within a claim, converting natural language
  to SQL, and utilizing biomedical knowledge graphs, in order to identify rows across
  multiple tables that prove the answer. A distinguishing and desirable characteristic
  of DOSSIER is that no private medical records are shared with an LLM.  An extensive
  experimental evaluation is conducted over a large corpus of medical records demonstrating
  improved accuracy over five baselines.  Our methods provide hope that physicians
  can privately, quickly, and accurately fact check a claim in an evidence-based fashion.
