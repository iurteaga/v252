title: Multimodal Sleep Apnea Detection with Missing or Noisy Modalities
abstract: Polysomnography (PSG) is a type of sleep study that records multimodal physiological
  signals and is widely used for purposes such as sleep staging and respiratory event
  detection. Conventional machine learning methods assume that each sleep study is
  associated with a fixed set of observed modalities and that all modalities are available
  for each sample. However, noisy and missing modalities are a common issue in real-world
  clinical settings. In this study, we propose a comprehensive pipeline aiming to
  compensate for the missing or noisy modalities when performing sleep apnea detection.
  Unlike other existing studies, our proposed model works with any combination of
  available modalities. Our experiments show that the proposed model outperforms other
  state-of-the-art approaches in sleep apnea detection using various subsets of available
  data and different levels of noise, and maintains its high performance (AUROC$>$0.9)
  even in the presence of high levels of noise or missingness. This is especially
  relevant in settings where the level of noise and missingness is high (such as pediatric
  or outside-of-clinic scenarios).
