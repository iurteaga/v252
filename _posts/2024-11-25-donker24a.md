title: Multinomial belief networks for healthcare data
abstract: Healthcare data from patient or population cohorts are often characterized
  by sparsity, high missingness and relatively small sample sizes.  In addition, being
  able to quantify uncertainty is often important in a medical context.  To address
  these analytical requirements we propose a deep generative Bayesian model for multinomial
  count data. We develop a collapsed Gibbs sampling procedure that takes advantage
  of a series of augmentation relations, inspired by the Zhou–Cong–Chen model. We
  visualise the model’s ability to identify coherent substructures in the data using
  a dataset of handwritten digits.  We then apply it to a large experimental dataset
  of DNA mutations in cancer and show that we can identify biologically meaningful
  clusters of mutational signatures in a fully data-driven way.
