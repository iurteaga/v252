title: 'NeRF-US: Removing Ultrasound Imaging Artifacts from Neural Radiance Fields
  in the Wild'
abstract: Current methods for performing 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis
  (NVS) in ultrasound imaging data often face severe artifacts when training NeRF-based
  approaches. The artifacts produced by current approaches differ from NeRF floaters
  in general scenes because of the unique nature of ultrasound capture. Furthermore,
  existing models fail to produce reasonable 3D reconstructions when ultrasound data
  is captured or obtained casually in uncontrolled environments, which is common in
  clinical settings. Consequently, existing reconstruction and NVS methods struggle
  to handle ultrasound motion, fail to capture intricate details, and cannot model
  transparent and reflective surfaces. In this work, we introduced NeRF-US, which
  incorporates 3D-geometry guidance for border probability and scattering density
  into NeRF training, while also utilizing ultrasound-specific rendering over traditional
  volume rendering. These 3D priors are learned through a diffusion model. Through
  experiments conducted on our new "Ultrasound in the Wild" dataset, we observed accurate,
  clinically plausible, artifact-free reconstructions.
