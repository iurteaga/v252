title: 'FairEHR-CLP: Towards Fairness-Aware Clinical Predictions with Contrastive
  Learning in Multimodal Electronic Health Records'
abstract: 'In the high-stakes realm of healthcare, ensuring fairness in predictive
  models is crucial. Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become integral to medical
  decision-making, yet existing methods for enhancing model fairness restrict themselves
  to unimodal data and fail to address the multifaceted social biases intertwined
  with demographic factors in EHRs. To mitigate these biases, we present $\textit{FairEHR-CLP}$:
  a general framework for $\textbf{Fair}$ness-aware Clinical $\textbf{P}$redictions
  with $\textbf{C}$ontrastive $\textbf{L}$earning in $\textbf{EHR}$s. FairEHR-CLP
  operates through a two-stage process, utilizing patient demographics, longitudinal
  data, and clinical notes. First, synthetic counterparts are generated for each patient,
  allowing for diverse demographic identities while preserving essential health information.
  Second, fairness-aware predictions employ contrastive learning to align patient
  representations across sensitive attributes, jointly optimized with an MLP classifier
  with a softmax layer for clinical classification tasks. Acknowledging the unique
  challenges in EHRs, such as varying group sizes and class imbalance, we introduce
  a novel fairness metric to effectively measure error rate disparities across subgroups.
  Extensive experiments on three diverse EHR datasets on three tasks demonstrate the
  effectiveness of FairEHR-CLP in terms of fairness and utility compared with competitive
  baselines. FairEHR-CLP represents an advancement towards ensuring both accuracy
  and equity in predictive healthcare models.'
