title: 'A LUPI distillation-based approach: Application to predicting Proximal Junctional
  Kyphosis'
abstract: We propose a learning algorithm called XGBoost+, a modified version of the
  extreme gradient boosting algorithm (XGBoost). The new algorithm utilizes privileged
  information (PI), data collected after inference time. XGBoost+ incorporates PI
  into a distillation framework for XGBoost. We also evaluate our proposed method
  on a real-world clinical dataset about Proximal Junctional Kyphosis (PJK).  Our
  approach outperforms vanilla XGBoost, SVM, and SVM+ on various datasets. Our approach
  showcases the advantage of using privileged information to improve the performance
  of machine learning models in healthcare, where data after inference time can be
  leveraged to build better models.
