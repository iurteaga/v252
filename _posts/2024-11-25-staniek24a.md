title: Early Prediction of Causes (not Effects) in Healthcare by Long-Term Clinical
  Time Series Forecasting
abstract: Machine learning for early syndrome diagnosis aims to solve the intricate
  task of predicting a ground truth label that most often is the outcome (effect)
  of a medical consensus definition applied to observed clinical measurements (causes),
  given clinical measurements observed several hours before. Instead of focusing on
  the prediction of the future effect, we propose to directly predict the causes via
  time series forecasting (TSF) of clinical variables and determine the effect by
  applying the gold standard consensus definition to the forecasted values.  This
  method has the invaluable advantage of being straightforwardly interpretable to
  clinical practitioners, and because model training does not rely on a particular
  label anymore, the forecasted data can be used to predict any consensus-based label.  We
  exemplify our method by means of long-term TSF with Transformer models, with a focus
  on accurate prediction of sparse clinical variables involved in the SOFA-based Sepsis-3
  definition and the new Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS-II) definition.  Our
  experiments are conducted on two datasets and show that contrary to recent proposals
  which advocate set function encoders for time series and direct multi-step decoders,
  best results are achieved by a combination of standard dense encoders with iterative
  multi-step decoders.  The key for success of iterative multi-step decoding can be
  attributed to its ability to capture cross-variate dependencies and to a student
  forcing training strategy that teaches the model to rely on its own previous time
  step predictions for the next time step prediction.
