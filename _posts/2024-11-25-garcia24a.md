title: 'Risk stratification through class-conditional conformal estimation: A strategy
  that improves the rule-out performance of MACE in the prehospital setting'
abstract: Accurate risk stratification of clinical scores is important to mitigate
  adverse outcomes in patient care.  In this study we explore whether class-conditional
  conformal estimation can yield better risk stratification cutoffs, as measured by
  rule-out and rule-in performance. In the binary setting, the cutoffs are chosen
  to theoretically bound the false positive rate (FPR) and the false negative rate
  (FNR). We showcase rule-out performance improvements for the task of 30-day major
  adverse cardiac event (MACE) prediction in the prehospital setting over standard
  of care HEART and HEAR algorithms. Further, we observe the theoretical bounds materialize
  96% and 77% of the time for FPR and FNR respectively across multiple datasets. Improving
  risk score accuracy is important since inaccurate stratification can lead to significant
  negative patient outcomes. For instance, in the case of MACE prediction, better
  rule-out performance translates into less delay of time dependent therapies that
  restore bloodflow to the compromised myocardium, thereby reducing morbidity and
  mortality.
