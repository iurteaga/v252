title: Leveraging LLMs for Multimodal Medical Time Series Analysis
abstract: 'The complexity and heterogeneity of data in many real-world applications
  pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning and signal processing
  techniques. For instance, in medicine, effective analysis of diverse physiological
  signals is crucial for patient monitoring and clinical decision-making and yet highly
  challenging. We introduce MedTsLLM, a general multimodal large language model (LLM)
  framework that effectively integrates time series data and rich contextual information
  in the form of text to analyze physiological signals, performing three tasks with
  clinical relevance: semantic segmentation, boundary detection, and anomaly detection
  in time series. These critical tasks enable deeper analysis of physiological signals
  and can provide actionable insights for clinicians. We utilize a reprogramming layer
  to align embeddings of time series patches with a pretrained LLMâ€™s embedding space
  and make effective use of raw time series, in conjunction with textual context.
  Given the multivariate nature of medical datasets, we develop methods to handle
  multiple covariates. We additionally tailor the text prompt to include patient-specific
  information. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including deep learning
  models, other LLMs, and clinical methods across multiple medical domains, specifically
  electrocardiograms and respiratory waveforms. MedTsLLM presents a promising step
  towards harnessing the power of LLMs for medical time series analysis that can elevate
  data-driven tools for clinicians and improve patient outcomes.'
