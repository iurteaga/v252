title: Benchmarking Reliability of Deep Learning Models for Pathological Gait Classification
abstract: Early detection of neurodegenerative disorders is an important open problem,
  since early diagnosis and treatment may yield a better prognosis. Researchers have
  recently sought to leverage advances in machine learning algorithms to detect symptoms
  of altered gait, possibly corresponding to the emergence of neurodegenerative etiologies.
  However, while several claims of positive and accurate detection have been made
  in the recent literature, using a variety of sensors and algorithms, solutions are
  far from being realized in practice. This paper analyzes existing approaches to
  identify gaps inhibiting translation. Using a set of experiments across three Kinect-simulated
  and one real Parkinsonâ€™s patient datasets, we highlight possible sources of errors
  and generalization failures in these approaches. Based on these observations, we
  propose our strong baseline called Asynchronous Multi-Stream Graph Convolutional
  Network (AMS-GCN) that can reliably differentiate multiple categories of pathological
  gaits across datasets.
