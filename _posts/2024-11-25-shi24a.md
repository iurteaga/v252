title: Network-Assisted Mediation Analysis with High-Dimensional Neuroimaging Mediators
abstract: Mediation analysis is a widely used statistical approach to estimate the
  causal pathways through which an exposure affects an outcome via intermediate variables,
  i.e., mediators. In many applications, high-dimensional correlated biomarkers are
  potential mediators, posing challenges to standard mediation analysis approaches.
  However, some of these biomarkers, such as neuroimaging measures across brain regions,
  often exhibit hierarchical network structures that can be leveraged to advance mediation
  analysis. In this paper, we aim to study how brain cortical thickness, characterized
  by a star-shaped hierarchical network structure, mediates the effect of maternal
  smoking on childrenâ€™s cognitive abilities within the adolescent brain cognitive
  development (ABCD) study. We propose a network-assisted mediation analysis approach
  based on a conditional Gaussian graphical model to account for the star-shaped network
  structure of neuroimaging mediators. Within our framework, the joint indirect effect
  of these mediators is decomposed into the indirect effect through hub mediators
  and the indirect effects solely through each leaf mediator. This decomposition provides
  mediator-specific insights and informs efficient intervention designs. Additionally,
  after accounting for hub mediators, the indirect effects solely through each leaf
  mediator can be identified and evaluated individually, thereby addressing the challenges
  of high-dimensional correlated mediators. In our study, our proposed approach identifies
  a brain region as a significant leaf mediator, a finding that existing approaches
  cannot discover.
