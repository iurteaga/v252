title: 'FineRadScore: A Radiology Report Line-by-Line Evaluation Technique Generating
  Corrections with Severity Scores'
abstract: The current gold standard for evaluating generated chest x-ray (CXR) reports
  is through radiologist annotations. However, this process can be extremely time-consuming
  and costly, especially when evaluating large numbers of reports. In this work, we
  present FineRadScore, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based automated evaluation metric
  for generated CXR reports. Given a candidate report and a ground-truth report, FineRadScore
  gives the minimum number of line-by-line corrections required to go from the candidate
  to the ground-truth report. Additionally, FineRadScore provides an error severity
  rating with each correction and generates comments explaining why the correction
  was needed. We demonstrate that FineRadScore’s corrections and error severity scores
  align with radiologist opinions. We also show that, when used to judge the quality
  of the report as a whole, FineRadScore aligns with radiologists as well as current
  state-of-the-art automated CXR evaluation metrics. Finally, we analyze FineRadScore’s
  shortcomings to provide suggestions for future improvements.
