title: Decision-Focused Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Reward Transfer
abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) provides a way to learn a transition
  model of the environment, which can then be used to plan personalized policies for
  different patient cohorts, and to understand the dynamics involved in the decision-making
  process. However, standard MBRL algorithms are either sensitive to changes in the
  reward function or achieve suboptimal performance on the task when the transition
  model is restricted. Motivated by the need to use simple and interpretable models
  in critical domains such as healthcare, we propose a novel robust decision-focused
  (RDF) algorithm that learns a transition model that achieves high returns while
  being robust to changes in the reward function. We demonstrate our RDF algorithm
  can be used with several model classes and planning algorithms. We also provide
  theoretical and empirical envidence, on variety of simulators and real patient data,
  that RDF can learn simple yet effective models that can be used to plan personalized
  policies.
