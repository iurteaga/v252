title: To which reference class do you belong? Measuring racial fairness of reference
  classes with normative modeling
abstract: Reference classes in healthcare establish healthy norms, such as pediatric
  growth charts of height and weight, and are used to chart deviations from these
  norms which represent potential clinical risk. How the demographics of the reference
  class influence clinical interpretation of deviations is unknown. Using normative
  modeling, a method for building reference classes, we evaluate the fairness (racial
  bias) in reference models of structural brain images that are widely used in psychiatry
  and neurology. We test whether including “race” in the model creates fairer models.
  We predict self-reported race using the deviation scores from three different reference
  class normative models to better understand bias in an integrated, multivariate
  sense. Across all these tasks, we uncover racial disparities that are not easily
  addressed with existing data or commonly used modeling techniques. Our work suggests
  that deviations from the norm could be due to demographic mismatch with the reference
  class, and assigning clinical meaning to these deviations should be done with caution.
  Our approach also suggests that acquiring more representative samples is an urgent
  research priority.
