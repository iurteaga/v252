title: 'Beyond Clinical Trials: Using Real World Evidence to Investigate Heterogeneous,
  Time-Varying Treatment Effects'
abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), though essential for evaluating the
  efficacy of novel treatments, are costly and time-intensive. Due to strict eligibility
  criteria, RCTs may not adequately represent diverse patient populations, leading
  to equity issues and limited generalizability. Additionally, conventional trial
  analysis methods are limited by strict assumptions and biases. Real-world evidence
  (RWE) offers a promising avenue to explore treatment effects beyond trial settings,
  addressing gaps in representation and providing additional insights into patient
  outcomes over time. We introduce TRIALSCOPE-X and TRIALSCOPE-XL, machine learning
  pipelines designed to analyze treatment outcomes using RWE by mitigating biases
  that arise from observational data and addressing the limitations of conventional
  methods. We estimate causal, time-varying treatment effects across heterogeneous
  patient populations and varied timeframes. Preliminary results investigating the
  treatment benefit of Keytruda, a widely-used cancer immunotherapy drug, demonstrate
  the utility of our methods in evaluating treatment outcomes under novel settings
  and uncovering potential disparities. Our findings highlight the potential of RWE-based
  analysis to provide data-driven insights that inform evidence-based medicine and
  shape more inclusive and comprehensive clinical research, supplementing traditional
  clinical trial findings.
