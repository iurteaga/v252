title: 'MALADE: Orchestration of LLM-powered Agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation
  for Pharmacovigilance'
abstract: 'In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), given their remarkable text
  understanding and generation abilities, there is an unprecedented opportunity to
  develop new, LLM-based methods for trustworthy medical knowledge synthesis, extraction,
  and summarization. This paper focuses on the problem of Pharmacovigilance (PhV),
  where the significance and challenges lie in identifying Adverse Drug Events (ADEs)
  from diverse text sources, such as medical literature, clinical notes, and drug
  labels. Unfortunately, this task is hindered by factors including variations in
  the terminologies of drugs and outcomes, and ADE descriptions often being buried
  in large amounts of narrative text. We present MALADE, the first effective collaborative
  multi-agent system powered by LLM with Retrieval Augmented Generation for ADE extraction
  from drug label data. This technique involves augmenting a query to an LLM with
  relevant information extracted from text resources and instructing the LLM to compose
  a response consistent with the augmented data. MALADE is a general LLM-agnostic
  architecture, and its unique capabilities are: (1) leveraging a variety of external
  sources, such as medical literature, drug labels, and FDA tools (e.g., OpenFDA drug
  information API), (2) extracting drug-outcome association in a structured format
  along with the strength of the association, and (3) providing explanations for established
  associations. Instantiated with GPT-4 Turbo or GPT-4o, and FDA drug label data,
  MALADE demonstrates its efficacy with an Area Under ROC Curve of 0.90 against the
  OMOP Ground Truth table of ADEs. Our implementation leverages the Langroid multi-agent
  LLM framework and can be found at https://github.com/jihyechoi77/malade.'
