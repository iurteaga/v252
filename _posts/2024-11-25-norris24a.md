title: Localising the Seizure Onset Zone from Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation
  Responses with a CNN Transformer
abstract: 'Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders, often requiring
  surgical intervention when medication fails to control seizures. For effective surgical
  outcomes, precise localisation of the epileptogenic focus - often approximated through
  the Seizure Onset Zone (SOZ) - is critical yet remains a challenge. Active probing
  through electrical stimulation is already standard clinical practice for identifying
  epileptogenic areas. Our study advances the application of deep learning for SOZ
  localisation using Single-Pulse Electrical Stimulation (SPES) responses, with two
  key contributions. Firstly, we implement an existing deep learning model to compare
  two SPES analysis paradigms: divergent and convergent. These paradigms evaluate
  outward and inward effective connections, respectively. We assess the generalisability
  of these models to unseen patients and electrode placements using held-out test
  sets. Our findings reveal a notable improvement in moving from a divergent (AUROC:
  0.574) to a convergent approach (AUROC: 0.666), marking the first application of
  the latter in this context. Secondly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CNN Transformers
  with cross-channel attention in handling heterogeneous electrode placements, increasing
  the AUROC to 0.730. These findings represent a significant step in modelling patient-specific
  intracranial EEG electrode placements in SPES. Future work will explore integrating
  these models into clinical decision-making processes to bridge the gap between deep
  learning research and practical healthcare applications.'
