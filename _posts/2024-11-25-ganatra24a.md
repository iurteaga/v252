title: 'PRECISe : Prototype-Reservation for Explainable classification under Imbalanced
  and Scarce-Data Settings'
abstract: Deep learning models used for medical image classification tasks are often
  constrained by the limited amount of training data along with severe class imbalance.
  Despite these problems, models should be explainable to enable human trust in the
  models’ decisions to ensure wider adoption in high risk situations. In this paper,
  we propose PRECISe, an explainable-by-design model meticulously constructed to concurrently
  address all three challenges. Evaluation on 2 imbalanced medical image datasets
  reveals that PRECISe outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on data efficient
  generalization to minority classes, achieving an accuracy of  87% in detecting pneumonia
  in chest x-rays upon training on <60 images only. Additionally, a case study is
  presented to highlight the model’s ability to produce easily interpretable predictions,
  reinforcing its practical utility and reliability for medical imaging tasks.
