title: Event-Based Contrastive Learning for Medical Time Series
abstract: In clinical practice, one often needs to identify whether a patient is at
  high risk of adverse outcomes after some key medical event. For example, quantifying
  the risk of adverse outcomes after an acute cardiovascular event helps healthcare
  providers identify those patients at the highest risk of poor outcomes; i.e., patients
  who benefit from invasive therapies that can lower their risk. Assessing the risk
  of adverse outcomes, however, is challenging due to the complexity, variability,
  and heterogeneity of longitudinal medical data, especially for individuals suffering
  from chronic diseases like heart failure. In this paper, we introduce Event-Based
  Contrastive Learning (EBCL) - a method for learning embeddings of heterogeneous
  patient data that preserves temporal information before and after key index events.
  We demonstrate that EBCL can be used to construct models that yield improved performance
  on important downstream tasks relative to other pretraining methods. We develop
  and test the method using a cohort of heart failure patients obtained from a large
  hospital network and the publicly available MIMIC-IV dataset consisting of patients
  in an intensive care unit at a large tertiary care center. On both cohorts, EBCL
  pretraining yields models that are performant with respect to a number of downstream
  tasks, including mortality, hospital readmission, and length of stay.  In addition,
  unsupervised EBCL embeddings effectively cluster heart failure patients into subgroups
  with distinct outcomes, thereby providing information that helps identify new heart
  failure phenotypes.  The contrastive framework around the index event can be adapted
  to a wide array of time-series datasets and provides information that can be used
  to guide personalized care.
