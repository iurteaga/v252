title: 'Mixed Type Multimorbidity Variational Autoencoder: A Deep Generative Model
  for Multimorbidity Analysis'
abstract: This paper introduces the Mixed Type Multimorbidity Variational Autoencoder
  ($\text{M}^{3}$VAE), a deep probabilistic generative model developed for supervised
  dimensionality reduction in the context of multimorbidity analysis. The model is
  designed to overcome the limitations of purely supervised or unsupervised approaches
  in this field. $\text{M}^{3}$VAE focuses on identifying latent representations of
  mixed-type health-related attributes essential for predicting patient survival outcomes.
  It integrates datasets with multiple modalities (by which we mean data of multiple
  types), encompassing health measurements, demographic details, and (potentially
  censored) survival outcomes. A key feature of $\text{M}^{3}$VAE is its ability to
  reconstruct latent representations that exhibit clustering patterns, thereby revealing
  important patterns in disease co-occurrence. This functionality provides insights
  for understanding and predicting health outcomes. The efficacy of $\text{M}^{3}$VAE
  has been demonstrated through experiments with both synthetic and real-world electronic
  health record data, showing its capability in identifying interpretable morbidity
  groupings related to future survival outcomes.
