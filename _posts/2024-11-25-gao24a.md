title: Predicting Long-Term Allograft Survival in Liver Transplant Recipients
abstract: Liver allograft failure occurs in approximately 20% of liver transplant
  recipients within five years post-transplant, leading to mortality or the need for
  retransplantation. Providing an accurate and interpretable model for individualized
  risk estimation of graft failure is essential for improving post-transplant care.
  To this end, we introduce the Model for Allograft Survival (MAS), a simple linear
  risk score that outperforms other advanced survival models. Using longitudinal patient
  follow-up data from the United States (U.S.), we develop our models on 82,959 liver
  transplant recipients and conduct multi-site evaluations on 11 regions. Additionally,
  by testing on a separate non-U.S. cohort, we explore the out-of-distribution generalization
  performance of various models without additional fine-tuning, a crucial property
  for clinical deployment. We find that the most complex models are also the ones
  most vulnerable to distribution shifts despite achieving the best in-distribution
  performance. Our findings not only provide a strong risk score for predicting long-term
  graft failure but also suggest that the routine machine learning pipeline with only
  in-distribution held-out validation could create harmful consequences for patients
  at deployment.
