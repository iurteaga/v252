title: 'MedAutoCorrect: Image-Conditioned Autocorrection in Medical Reporting'
abstract: 'In medical reporting, the accuracy of radiological reports, whether generated
  by humans or machine learning algorithms, is critical. We tackle a new task in this
  paper: image- conditioned autocorrection of inaccuracies within these reports. Using
  the MIMIC-CXR dataset, we first intentionally introduce a diverse range of errors
  into reports. Subsequently, we propose a two-stage framework capable of pinpointing
  these errors and then making corrections, simulating an autocorrection process.
  This method aims to address the short- comings of existing automated medical reporting
  systems, like factual errors and incorrect conclusions, enhancing report reliability
  in vital healthcare applications. Importantly, our approach could serve as a guardrail,
  ensuring the accuracy and trustworthiness of automated report generation. Experiments
  on established datasets and state of the art report generation models validate this
  methodâ€™s potential in correcting medical reporting errors.'
