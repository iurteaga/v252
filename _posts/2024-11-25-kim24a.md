title: General-Purpose Retrieval-Enhanced Medical Prediction Model Using Near-Infinite
  History
abstract: Machine learning (ML) has recently shown promising results in medical predictions
  using electronic health records (EHRs).  However, since ML models typically have
  a limited capability in terms of input sizes, selecting specific medical events
  from EHRs for use as input is necessary.  This selection process, often relying
  on expert opinion, can cause bottlenecks in development.  We propose Retrieval-Enhanced
  Medical prediction model (REMed) to address such challenges.  REMed can essentially
  evaluate unlimited medical events, select the relevant ones, and make predictions.  This
  allows for an unrestricted input size, eliminating the need for manual event selection.  We
  verified these properties through experiments involving 27 clinical prediction tasks
  across four independent cohorts, where REMed outperformed the baselines.  Notably,
  we found that the preferences of REMed align closely with those of medical experts.  We
  expect our approach to significantly expedite the development of EHR prediction
  models by minimizing cliniciansâ€™ need for manual involvement.
