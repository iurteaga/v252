title: 'CORE-BEHRT: A Carefully Optimized and Rigorously Evaluated BEHRT'
abstract: The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has significantly
  increased the amount of available healthcare data. This has allowed models inspired
  by Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision, which scale exceptionally
  well, to be used in EHR research. Particularly, BERT-based models have surged in
  popularity following the release of BEHRT and Med-BERT. Subsequent models have largely
  built on these foundations despite the fundamental design choices of these pioneering
  models remaining underexplored. Through incremental optimization, we study BERT-based
  EHR modeling and isolate the sources of improvement for key design choices, giving
  us insights into the effect of data representation, individual technical components,
  and training procedure.  Evaluating this across a set of generic tasks (death, pain
  treatment, and general infection), we showed that improving data representation
  can increase the average downstream performance from 0.785 to 0.797 AUROC ($p <
  10^{-7}$), primarily when including medication and timestamps. Improving the architecture
  and training protocol on top of this increased average downstream performance to
  0.801 AUROC ($p < 10^{-7}$). We then demonstrated the consistency of our optimization
  through a rigorous evaluation across 25 diverse clinical prediction tasks. We observed
  significant performance increases in 17 out of 25 tasks and improvements in 24 tasks,
  highlighting the generalizability of our results. Our findings provide a strong
  foundation for future work and aim to increase the trustworthiness of BERT-based
  EHR models.
