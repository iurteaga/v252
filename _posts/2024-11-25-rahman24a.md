title: 'XDT-CXR: Investigating Cross-Disease Transferability in Zero-Shot Binary Classification
  of Chest X-Rays'
abstract: This study explores the concept of cross-disease transferability (XDT) in
  medical imaging, focusing on the potential of binary classifiers trained on one
  disease to perform zero-shot classification on another disease affecting the same
  organ. Utilizing chest X-rays (CXR) as the primary modality, we investigate whether
  a model trained on one pulmonary disease can make predictions about another novel
  pulmonary disease, a scenario with significant implications for medical settings
  with limited data on emerging diseases. The XDT framework leverages the embedding
  space of a vision encoder, which, through kernel transformation, aids in distinguishing
  between diseased and non-diseased classes in the latent space. This capability is
  especially beneficial in resource-limited environments or in regions with low prevalence
  of certain diseases, where conventional diagnostic practices may fail. However,
  the XDT framework is currently limited to binary classification, determining only
  the presence or absence of a disease rather than differentiating among multiple
  diseases. This limitation underscores the supplementary role of XDT to traditional
  diagnostic tests in clinical settings. Furthermore, results show that XDT-CXR as
  a framework is able to make better predictions comapred to other zero-shot learning
  (ZSL) baselines.
